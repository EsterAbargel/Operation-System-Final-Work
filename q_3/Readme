There is only one file set_policy.c, to compile it run: make
To run it, you have to provide two arguments: scheduler type and priority
The scheduler type is a number
You have to run the binary with "sudo"
An example:
sudo ./set_policy 2 15
2 is for SCHED_RR
15 is the priority
Now to check that the changes were applied we open another Terminal and use chrt
The binary set_policy when we run it, it will print its pid
so we can run chrt -p <pid_of_set_policy_binary> to see that the changes indeed were applied
