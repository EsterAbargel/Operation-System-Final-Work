There is only one source file named dir_traversal.c, to compile it run: make
It will output a binary named dir_traversal
I prepared a directory the same like that used in the question's example: dir
To run the binary: ./dir_traversal dir
It will traverse the directory and print same output of the question's example (but not the same order)
